# Source material for William Chappell's Popular Music of the Olden Time.

## History and background.

For almost 10 years, William Chappell ran the music publishing company co-founded by his father that became Chappell and Co and is now part of Warner Chappell Music. He left the company in 1843 to pursue his interest in antiquarian music.

He extended and rewrote an earlier work, "A Collection of National English Airs, consisting of Ancient Song, Ballad and Dance Tunes" published in 1838 as "Popular Music of Olden Time" in 1855.

The two volumes of the latter work form the basis for this project. 

Chappell was an important chronicler of the history of popular music in England and the two volumes are still important sources of information about their subject.

Of particular note is that he showed an early interest in musical forms that would be significant as interest in 'folk' music increased towards the later part of the 19th century.

## Resources
Digitisation of historical texts has made these volumes (and others by Chappell) available online and there are currently a number of scans available in pdf form from [archive.org] (https://archive.org/search.php?query=William%20Chappell&and[]=creator%3A%22chappell%2C+w.+%28william%29%2C+1809-1888%22) and other sources.

These are very useful resources and we should be thankful that they are available to a wider readership than those people who have access to a library with a physical copy.

However, the broad nature of these digitisation projects results in damaged and incomplete pages as the resources are not available to check the quality of each scan. Examples of 'damaged and incomplete' pages are library marks, reader annotations, water and ink damage, pages missing or assembled in the wrong order.

As we are fortunate to have multiple scans available of "Popular Music of Olden Time", it has been possible to create a composite version that is of a more accurate representation of each volume as it was originally published.
